This is the QGIS project file for the collaboration map (see example PDF's).

Hopefully it can find all the pictures when you load it? If not, sorry.

You need a recent enough version of QGIS (not sure what version that is...) and you can open the project file.

This will open up the map display which allows you to change the projection and the style of the things on the map.

Most likely, you just want to open the print layout (called slide) which includes things like the picture and text and logos.

If you want to modify the institutes on the map, you should modify institutes.csv
